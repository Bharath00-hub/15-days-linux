## Day 2: File and Directory Creation

## 📁 1. Creating and Deleting Files and Folders

| Task                   | Command                                 |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Create a file          | `touch filename.txt`                     |
| Create a folder        | `mkdir foldername`                       |
| Create nested folders  | `mkdir -p folder1/folder2/folder3`       |
| Delete a file          | `rm filename.txt`                        |
| Delete an empty folder | `rmdir foldername`                       |
| Delete a folder with files | `rm -r foldername/`                 |

> ⚠️ Use `rm -i` to ask confirmation before deleting:  
> `rm -i important.txt`

## 🗂️ 2. Organizing Data with Directories

- Use folders to group related files:
  - `~/Projects/Linux`
  - `~/Documents/College`
- Use descriptive names:
  - `resume_final_2025.pdf`
  - `day2_script.sh`

> 💡 Keep your home directory clean by using subfolders.

## 📍 3. Using Absolute vs Relative Paths

| Type        | Description                                 | Example                                    |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Absolute**| Full path from root `/`                     | `/home/user/Documents/file.txt`           |
| **Relative**| Path from current directory (`.` or `..`)   | `../Downloads/file.txt` or `./file.txt`   |

> ✅ Use `pwd` to print the current path, and `cd` to change directory.

## 📄 4. Understanding File Extensions in Linux

- Linux doesn't **require** file extensions but uses them for convenience.
- Common examples:
  - `.sh` → Shell script
  - `.txt` → Text file
  - `.tar.gz` → Compressed archive
  - `.conf` → Configuration file
  - `.py` → Python script

> 📌 Use `file filename` to detect file type based on content.
