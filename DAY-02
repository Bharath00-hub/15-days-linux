## Day 2: File and Directory Creation

1. Creating and Deleting Files and Folders

touch filename.txt              # Create empty file
echo "Hello Linux" > file.txt   # Create file with text
mkdir myfolder                  # Create folder
rm filename.txt                 # Delete file
rmdir myfolder                  # Delete empty folder
rm -r myfolder                  # Delete folder with contents


🗃️ 2. Organizing Data with Directories

mkdir -p project/src/utils      # Create nested folders
mv file.txt project/            # Move file to folder
mv oldname.txt newname.txt      # Rename file
cp file.txt backup.txt          # Copy file
cp -r project/ project_backup/  # Copy folder with content


📍 3. Absolute vs Relative Paths

Absolute path:
cd /home/username/Documents/


Relative path:
cd ../Downloads/
