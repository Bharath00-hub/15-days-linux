## Day 4: Viewing File Contents


## 📖 1. Viewing Files Using `cat`, `less`, `more`, `head`, and `tail`

| Command       | Description                              | Example                       |
|---------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `cat`         | Displays the full file content           | `cat file.txt`                |
| `less`        | Opens file one page at a time (scroll)   | `less file.txt`               |
| `more`        | Similar to `less`, but older             | `more file.txt`               |
| `head`        | Shows the first 10 lines by default      | `head file.txt`               |
| `tail`        | Shows the last 10 lines by default       | `tail file.txt`               |
| `tail -f`     | Live view of file updates (e.g., logs)   | `tail -f /var/log/syslog`     |

> 🔎 Use `/search-term` inside `less` to search in the file  
> Press `q` to quit `less` or `more`

📌 _End of Day 4: You're now equipped to view and redirect file content efficiently in Linux!_
