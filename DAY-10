##  Day 10: User Management

## 👤 1. Understanding Users and Groups

- Linux uses users and groups for access control.
- Every user has a UID; every group has a GID.
- Files and directories are owned by a user and a group.

## ➕ 2. Adding and Deleting Users

### 👥 Add a new user

sudo adduser username             # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo useradd -m username          # RHEL/CentOS

❌ Delete a user

sudo deluser username             # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo userdel -r username          # RHEL/CentOS


🔐 3. Setting Passwords and Permissions

#Set or change user password

sudo passwd username

#Change file ownership

sudo chown user:group file.txt

#Change permissions

chmod 755 script.sh
chmod u+x filename.sh
