## Basic Navigation Commands

These commands help you move around the filesystem:

```bash
pwd            # Print Working Directory
ls             # List contents of current directory
cd <dirname>   # Change directory
cd ..          # Move one level up
cd /           # Go to root directory
cd ~           # Go to your home directory
clear          # Clear the screen
